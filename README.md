# Objective
Our goal was to create a website where users can search for other developers in a close proximity to collaborate on projects and connnect with those with similar interest in regards to programming

# Usage
Users can run this website by launching the domain www.pixelpair.tech

# Guide
Users will be greeted upon launching of the app. From there they will be asked to login or create an account.
Once they choose an option and is successfully authenticated into the webiste, then will see pictures of developers that they can connect with. Like applications such as Tinder, users have the ability to swipe left or right on those they are interested in. They will then be able to connect and chat with these users. Each user will have a user profile where they can post the link to their github, as well as any interests or ideas for projects they have,

# Hackathon
This project was for the MLH sponsored TCNJ Hackathon, where we had only 24 hours to make as much progress as possible.
